## from R data file

Let's use the function to split the abstract from a paper into every single word by using the str_split_one function with the pattern " ". This mean that you'll obtain a list of words that are separated by spaces. In this example the data is retrieved from an internal file from the package.

```{r}
library(regexcite)
x<-regexcite::testData
str_split_one(x[1,1], pattern = " ")
```
## "external" dataset

Now we're repeating the process for other different paragraph, the difference this time is that we're using an external CSV file.
```{r}
library(regexcite)
x<-read.csv(system.file("extdata", "TestCSV.csv", package = "regexcite"), header = FALSE)
str_split_one(x[1,1], pattern = " ")
```
